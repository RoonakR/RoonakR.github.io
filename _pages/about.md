# About Me
I am a passionate and curious Machine Learning researcher who enjoys learning new things. 

I am final year PhD researcher in Machine Learning at [Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP)](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/centre-vision-speech-signal-processing) at the University of Surrey. I am a researcher in [Healthy Home Programme](https://ukdri.ac.uk/team/payam-barnaghi) at [Care Research and Technology Centre](https://ukdri.ac.uk/centres/care-research-technology) at UK Dementia Research Institue (UK DRI). 

Other than being a Data Scientist, I enjoy reading books, learning about Psychology and Neuroscience, being in nature, cooking and kickboxing.

# Research interests
My main research interest is Machine Learning in the healthcare field. My main goal is to develop models which can deal with ML issues in healthcare such as; imbalance labels, error in data, algorithmic bias and interpretability. I am also interested in ethical and responsible AI. My main motivation and aim is using ML and AI technological solutions to have a positive social impact.
