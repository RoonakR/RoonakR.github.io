Bi-weekly Newsletters

My main objective as the society’s vice-president is to create the bi-weekly newsletter of society which is the main route of the communication for the society with interested individuals.

International ReproducibiliTea Virtual Conference
======
Surrey Reproducibility Society could get funding from the Surrey Institute of Advanced Studies, UK Reproducibility Network and Reproducible Research Oxford to organise a half day international virtual conference. We collaborated with core ReproducibiliTea team which included early career researchers from different universities in the UK to organize the meeting “How can ECRs influence research culture and integrity". The meeting was a successful virtual meeting with 300+ attendees and inspired further online discussions on this topic which resulted in a blog post. For this event, my role was to take care of the participant registration process and communication to ensure that attendees had a good experience and could make the most out of the meeting.

Surrey Reproducibility Society Recognition Award 
======
In November 2020, at SRS we organised a Recognition Award for writing a short article answering the question: “How do you champion open and reproducible research?” for PhDs and ECRs at University of Surrey. Which has been a successful experience which results in article publication and a session “University of Surrey Open Research and Transparency Showcase” with presentation of shortlisted applications of the award. My role was to be the communication bridge between applicants and organisers and to take care of the applications and assigning the reviewers to applications.
