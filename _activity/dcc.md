For organising the “New Horizons: Doctoral College Conference 2020”, I worked in an interdisciplinary team of PGRs from different departments. The conference in 2020 was the first virtual Doctoral College conference and it was successful with in total around 300 online attendees in 2 days with 98% attendance rate. As programme officer, my role was to arrange the conference program and to ensure that the program and meeting was interesting for attendees to remain in the meeting. Also, I organised the abstract review process and assigned abstracts to reviews and made sure that the process is reliable and fair.
